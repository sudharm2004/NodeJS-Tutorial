console in javascript uses console web api while in node js it uses console module

Modules are small units of independent, reusable code that is desired to be used as the building blocks in creating a non-trivial Javascript application. 
They are like inbuilt features.

global Modules:- modules that are not required to be imported or use require method.for eg:-console module,filename,dirname
Non-global Modules:-modules that are required to be imported or use require method.for eg:-fs,http module

every file is enclosed automaticallyfunction(exports,require,module,__filename,__dirname){
    //code
};
by node js

You can either get whole module or particular function of the module 
for eg:- you only want readfile function of fs module you can do
const fs=require('fs').writeFileSync;
fs('hello.txt','this is hello from node js')

package file keeps the information of your project like package name,description,git repository,packages in project.npm init is used to create package.json

package-lock-json keeps the details of packages.

node js is single threaded.It executed every command line by line

buffer:-temporary memory location required to run the program
